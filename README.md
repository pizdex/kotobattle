# Koto Battle: Tengai no Moribito (コトバトル－天外の守人－)
This is a disassembly of Koto Battle. I'm mainly interested in translating the game although not sure where to start.

It builds the following ROM:
- [**kotobattle.gbc**](https://archive.org/download/nointro.gbc/Koto%20Battle%20-%20Tengai%20no%20Moribito%20%28Japan%29.7z/Koto%20Battle%20-%20Tengai%20no%20Moribito%20%28Japan%29.gbc) `MD5: 43351cd46357bd1615a713490401fda8`
(baserom is required)
